# Database Management System

This repo contains a bare-bones database implementation, which supports
executing simple transactions in series. It contains support for
B+ tree indices, efficient join algorithms, query optimization, multigranularity
locking to support concurrent execution of transactions, and database recovery.

## Overview

This database management system project contains four major topics:

### [B+ tree indices](/src/main/java/edu/berkeley/cs186/database/index)
### [Joins and Query Optimization](/src/main/java/edu/berkeley/cs186/database/query)
### [Concurrency](/src/main/java/edu/berkeley/cs186/database/concurrency)
### [Recovery](/src/main/java/edu/berkeley/cs186/database/recovery)
